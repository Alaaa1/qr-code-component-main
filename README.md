## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how I can easily center my elements using CSS Flexbox:

```css
body {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  min-height: 100vh;
}
```

### Continued development

I need to continue practicing my CSS especially when it comes down to using Flexbox and Gridbox
